/*  what is floor and What is ceil
Explanation for floor
The largest number that <= x is called floor
For ceil
The smallest number >= x is called ceil

Example 1:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 5
Result: 4 7
Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 8
Result: 8 8
Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.*/

/*
Output: The floor and ceil are: 4 7
Time Complexity: O(logN), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are basically using the Binary Search algorithm.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using no extra space.
